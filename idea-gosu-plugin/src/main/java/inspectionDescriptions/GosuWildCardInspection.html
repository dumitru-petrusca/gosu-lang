Upgrade Gosu code that uses Java-like wildcards. <br>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<br>Gosu allowed you to use Java-like wildcards in a type argument in a generic type instance but it never
supported them at the semantic level. It was just syntactic sugar as shown by the following transformations:
<ul>
    <li>from List&lt;?&gt; to List&lt;Object&gt;
    <li>from List&lt;? extends T&gt; to List&lt;T&gt;
    <li>from List&lt;? super T&gt; to List&lt;UPPERBOUND(T)&gt;
</ul>

This inspection allows you to upgrade your code so that it will continue to behave as before by doing the above replacements.

<br>


<p>
    Note that under normal circumstances this inspection should be disabled as it was designed to be run just for the upgrade process.
